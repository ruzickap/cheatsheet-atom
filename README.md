This repository provides a comprehensive cheatsheet for the Atom text editor.
It's designed to help users quickly find and learn keyboard shortcuts,
commands, and other useful tips to enhance their productivity with Atom.

## What's Inside?

This cheatsheet covers a wide array of Atom's functionalities, including:

*   General editor operations and file management.
*   Efficient text editing: navigation, selection, modification, and
    bookmarking.
*   Character case transformations.
*   Powerful find and replace tools.
*   View customization: zooming, fullscreen mode, and pane management.
*   Tree view navigation and manipulation.
*   Integrated GitHub features.
*   Commands for the popular Git Plus package.
*   Shortcuts for other helpful Atom plugins (e.g., project-manager,
    git-time-machine, blame, merge-conflicts, git-diff).
*   Key items from the Command Palette.

## How to Use This Cheatsheet

The primary output of this project is a PDF file named `atom_cheatsheet.pdf`.
This file is automatically generated via GitHub Actions whenever changes are
pushed to the repository (on branches other than `main`) or when the build
workflow is manually triggered.

You can download the latest version of the cheatsheet (and other formats like
PNG, JPG, SVG) by following these steps:

1.  Navigate to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/ruzickap/cheatsheet-atom/actions)
    of this repository.
2.  Look for the "latex-build" workflow in the list of workflows.
3.  Click on the latest successful run for that workflow (usually the one at
    the top with a green checkmark).
4.  Scroll down to the "Artifacts" section and download the "latex-build"
    artifact. This will be a ZIP file containing `atom_cheatsheet.pdf` and
    other generated files (e.g., `atom_cheatsheet.png`, `atom_cheatsheet.jpg`,
    `atom_cheatsheet.svg`).
